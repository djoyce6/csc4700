What is your favorite movie?

Baby Driver. Everything is incredibly choreographed to the songs played (which are all also excellent)

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

The one continent that I am missing is Antarctica, so I would want to go there to be able to say I've been on all 7.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

Teleportation. Wanting to go places on a whim is something that happens to me a lot, and if I could do it instantaneously I could have a lot of fun.
